The system aims to enhance the learning experience by clustering students and recommending tailored learning paths based on individual performance metrics.

## Features
- **Student Clustering**: Grouping students based on their learning behaviors and performance.
- **Learning style classification**: Classifying what is the best learning style for each student.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Generating customized learning paths for each student.
