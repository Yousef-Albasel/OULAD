# Personalized Learning System

## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on developing a personalized learning system utilizing the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). The system aims to enhance the learning experience by clustering students and recommending tailored learning paths based on individual performance metrics.

## Features
- **Student Clustering**: Grouping students based on their learning behaviors and performance.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Generating customized learning paths for each student.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing student performance and progress metrics.

## Dataset
The project uses the [OULAD dataset](http://ocrdata.org/) to analyze and draw insights about student learning patterns.
